Folder are available here containing complementary results and analytical scripts of the study in which we inferred phylogeographic 
richness, diversity, and endemism of small terrestrial vertebrates in Amazonia, their potential predictors and regionalizations of
phylobetadiversity. The files deposited here are intended for review, since the manuscript is still in the submission process.
