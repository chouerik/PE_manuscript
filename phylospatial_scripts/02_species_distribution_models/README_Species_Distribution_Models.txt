This folder constains the scripts used to model species distributions through the maximum entropy approach of Maxent applied by Choueri et al (in prep). We also make available the occurrence points of Alopoglossus angulatus and the bioclimatic and topographic variables used in our study as executable example. 
This script was developed in a version prior to ENMeval package 2.0. All scripts were architected on Linux/Mac systems.

For more information on the scope of our study, methods, results, and references, see Choueri et al, in prep.
