# This script runs bGMYC method to propose intraspecific lineages following the steps below:
# 1. Selecting conspecific terminals from a phylogenetic trees inferred for the genus as a hole;
# 2. Adjustment of priors through a delimitation analyzes using a single tree;
# 3. Computation of delimitation analysis considering multiple trees. Graphics of parameters settings, convergence of runs, and heatmaps of posterior probabilities are also created here;
# 4. Generates a list of proposed lineages for pre-defined multiple thresholds. 
# Obs: The data used here as example is the ultrametric tree composed of samples of the genus Alopoglossus inferred by Choueri et al., in prep).
