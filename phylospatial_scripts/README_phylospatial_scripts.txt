This folder contains the scripts used for analyses of intraspecific lineages delimitation, species distribution modeling, inference of lineage distributions, analyses of phylogeographic richness, diversity, and endemism, spatial correlation analyses, and regionalizations of phylobetadiversity components (Choueri et al., in prep). Details about the analyses are specified in README files within each folder and also in the scripts.
