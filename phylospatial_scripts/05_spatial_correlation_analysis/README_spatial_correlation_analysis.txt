This folder contains the scripts for the analysis for spatial correlation analysis between phylogeographic surfaces and their potential predictors used by Choueri et al., in prep.
In order to reduce the computational time spent to run the example, the script computes the analyzes at 2°. 
As an example, we provide the phylogeographic surfaces obtained for lizards in Choueri et al (in prep), the surfaces of fraction of photosynthetically absorbed active radiation (fPAR) and gross primary productivity (GPP) made available by Radeloff et al., 2019, the surfaces of hydrographic basins available by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the availability of soil cations modeled by Zuquim et al., 2019, and the stability of the Amazonia biome over the past 30,000 years inferred by Costa et al., 2017. All these surfaces were croped to the Amazônia sensu latissimo.
Uploading some of the tested surfaces as predictors was only possible by compressing them. Please unzip them before running the executable example.
Details about the analysis settings are available in R script.

For more information on the scope of our study, methods, results, and references, see Choueri et al, in prep.
