This folder contains the scripts used to calculate Lineages Richness (LR), Phylogeographic diversity (PD), Lineages Weighted Endemism (LWE), and Phylogeographic Endemism (PE) in Choueri et al (in prep). Residuals surfaces of PE/WE and PD/LWE are also computed.
The original scripts were developed by Rosauer et al (2015) and are available at https://github.com/DanRosauer/phylospatial/tree/master/LineageModels/phylogenetic diversity from models.r.
For the implementation of the method it is also necessary to download the script 'phylogenetic endemism.r' available in the same folder.

Here we shared the script '04_Phylogeographic_endemism_from_models.r' that contains slight differences from the original script, the original script 'phylogenetic endemism.r' and data for few lizards species as executable example. All the scripts were architected on Linux/Mac systems.

For more information on the scope of our study, methods, results, and references, see Choueri et al, in prep.
