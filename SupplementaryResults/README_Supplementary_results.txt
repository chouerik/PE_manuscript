This folder contains the supplementary results of the study of phylogeographic endemism of small Amazonian terrestrial vertebrates.
Briefly, we inferred phylogenetic trees by BEAST and MrBayes to delimit intraspecific lineages through three molecular methods
(bGMYC, mPTP and ASAP) and build phylogeographic trees containing only the branches referring to lineage diversification. Posteriorly
species distribution models were inferred to generate suitability surfaces that were partitioned across specific lineages
through the method described by Rosauer et al. (2015), aiming to estimate the spatial distribution of each delimited lineage. Distributions and trees
of lineages were used together to infer surfaces of richness, diversity and phylogeographic endemism and regionalizations of phylobetadiversity.
The phylogeographic surfaces were submitted to spatial correlation analyzes with ecological, pedological, paleoenvironmental and physiographic variables in order to
determine its potential determinants.
