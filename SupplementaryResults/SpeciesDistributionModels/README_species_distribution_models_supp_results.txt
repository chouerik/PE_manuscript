This folder contains the inferred distribution models for each species of the present study, aiming to provide the suitability surfaces that were partitioned to infer the lineage distributions. The color gradient corresponds to the values of the total species suitability.

The results deposited here were generated by the scripts available at https://github.com/chouerik/PE_manuscript/tree/main/phylospatial_scripts/02_species_distribution_models
