This folder contains the complementary results of the phylobetadiversity analyzes inferred by the scripts available in https://github.com/chouerik/PE_manuscript/tree/main/phylospatial_scripts/06_phylobetadiversity

In 'ExplainedDissimilarity_Sillhouette.pdf', we choose the number of clusters (PRs) for each component of the phylobetadiversity of lizard, marsupial and rodent communities based on the explained dissimilarity and silhouette. The best number of clusters obtained for each resolution is indicated by the circle with a cross. For more details, see the main text and Supplementary Material.

In 'Regionalizations_multipleresolutions.pdf', we exhibit the proposed regionalizations for phylobetadiversity and its components for lizards, marsupials, and rodents in the Amazon biome at coarser resolutions (1.25째, 1.5째, 1.75째 and 2째). Colors correspond to phylogeographic regions (PR). The hierarchical dissimilarity relationships between the PRs are represented by the adjacent cladograms.
