Lineages distribution models for lizards, marsupials and rodents inferred in Amazonia (represented by the outlined area). The color gradient corresponds to the values of the overall suitability partitioned among the lineages of the correspondent species' SDM.

The lineages distribution models were inferred by the method described by Rosauer et al. (2015), following the scripts available at https://github.com/chouerik/PE_manuscript/tree/main/phylospatial_scripts/03_lineages_distribution_models
